Remote Timelapse for Windows Phone 8.

Aim is to create two applications: one for Windows Phone 8 (Eg, on my Lumia 1020) another for Windows Desktop.

Desktop is used to remotely control the camera on the phone via Wifi. Camera settings (focus, ISO, exposure,
brightness, etc) are configured from the desktop as well as shot-to-shot time, aka, frame rate.  Phone takes
photos and timed intervals and transfers images back to Desktop which then displays them and writes to disk.

Key limitation is obviously shot-to-shot time as entire image will need to be transferred via wifi, and some
phones (eg, Lumia 1020) are pretty slow anyway. But then, that's what timelapse is all about!  So long as the
timing is consistent.
